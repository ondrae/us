      <h1>REGISTRY</h1>
      <p>We are so grateful to have such wonderful loving people in our lives. Thank you for visiting our site! We looking forward to spending good times with you in May!</p>
      <h2 class="date">HEATH CERAMICS</h2>
      <p>Heath Ceramics is a local, classic, and sustainable craft that we are proud to support. We've chosen a Virtual Registry with Heath, which gives us the flexibility to review our fulfilled registry items and decide when/where to ship the lovely gifts you've given us. This means we're asking that you purchase items online, instead of going to a Heath store to make the purchase. Thank you so much for your understanding and for following this process. It means a lot to us!</p>
