      <p>Ha! It is probably no surprise to most of you that we have a theme. Our goal is to have you channel your <b>"inner neon"</b> in whatever capacity suits you best. We welcome all things bright, fun, and fabulous. Let's keep it classy and dress to impress. The Neon Museum is a truly photogenic place, so why not complement the space.</p>

      <p>Please arrive at least 15 minutes before the ceremony to check in at the La Concha Visitor Center upon arrival. The ceremony will begin promptly at 6pm and will be standing room only with a few benches for those who must be seated. If you decide to drive, parking is available in the lot off of McWilliams Avenue.</p>
      <p>After the ceremony you have the option to take the first shuttle trip (around 6:30PM) or to hang around while we take couple/family photos and board the second shuttle trip back to the hotel (around 7PM). The reception is a short 6-minute walk from the hotel.<p/>
